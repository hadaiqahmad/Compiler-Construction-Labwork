# Compiler-Construction-Labwork
<p>The successful completion of the labs has enabled me to develop an understanding of compiler construction
concepts, tools and key technique. By these labs now I am able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>

Understand the fundamental concepts, components and phases of a compilation system.
</li>
<li>
Develop a prototype compiler for an arbitrary language or write a compilation pass for an existing
compilation system such as GCC or LLVM.
</li>
<li>
Look at compilation systems and see the different trade-offs such as power consumption, performance
(compilation time/execution time/object code size) and code optimization. 
</li>
